    abstractNote = {The Fermilab Accelerator Division Electronic logbook (E-log) is a record of all the activities and events in the Division for the past 10 years and more. The E-log search function is a valuable resource and the institutional memory of the accelerator complex. About 300,000 files are stored in the E-log, of which the vast majority are images attached to entries and comments. The visual information contained in the images is not presently searchable. The goal of team NOICE (Neural Optical Image Categorizer for the E-log) was to design a neural network able to produce label categories for these images for use by searches. The group developed a dataset and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) with optimized hyperparameter},
